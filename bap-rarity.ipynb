    "Generates the rarity analysis and graphics used in:\n",
    "<i>Defining techniques to highlight rarity in search of potentially conservation reliant species using nationwide habitat prediction models for the United States</i>.\n",
    "Authors: Anne Davidson, Leah Dunn, Kevin Gergely, Alexa McKerrow and Mackenzie Case\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs <a name=\"inputs\"></a>\n",
    "Relies on output from rarity_GapAnalyticDB.py (tblRarityHucAmph.csv, tblRarityHucBird.csv, tblRarityHucMamm.csv, tblRarityHucRept.csv) and IUCN_Gap.csv table from GAP Habitat Map Collection Item.\n",

    "The code in this notebook is intended to provide summaries for NVC vegetation types at multiple levels of the classification hierarchy. Summaries include information about the area occupied by each type, the percent of that area protected at GAP status 1 & 2, and 1, 2, & 3, and the area of each type being managed by ferderal and state agencies.\n",
    "It utilizes an SQL server database that was assembled by intersecting numerous spatial data layers including the PAD-US, species habitat maps, boundary layers such as states, counties, LCCs, ecoregions, etc. At the time this workflow was developed, the database was available on a local server. Hence, all code references a local instance of this database. This code is only replicable given access to a local instance of the database.\n",

    "  These analyses utilize the GAP Analytic database developed by Linda Schueck, Anne Davidson, and Leah Dunn at Boise State University. Information about access to a given instance of this database is pending. The database is described here: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58519506e4b0f99207c4f17c.\n",
